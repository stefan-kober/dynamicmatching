# Dynamic Matching Markets - Simulation

Repository to simulate dynamic matching markets with random arrival and departure processes.
Supplementary code to *Superiority of Instantaneous Decisions in Thin Dynamic Matching Markets* [1].

## Usage

Example usage is demonstrated in the file ```simulate.py```.
We provide two different ```Market``` classes, depending on the employed matching algorithms, namely the ```GreedyMarket``` and the ```PatientMarket```.
Further parameters are ```m```, i.e., the arrival rate, ```d```, the expected number of compatible partners arriving in 1 timeunit, the matching function, and the arrival and departure distributions.
When running a specified market, this always happens for a specified amount of time (```T```).

An example call of a ```GreedyMarket``` looks like this (see also ```simulate.py```)

```
market = GreedyMarket(
    m = 1000,
    d = 5,
    departureDistribution = DepartureDistribution.CONSTANT,
    departureDistributionParameters = {"value":1},
    arrivalDistribution = ArrivalDistribution.POISSON,
    matchFunction = MatchFunction.RANDOM
)

print(market.run(100))
```

Evaluations can only be performed on markets that have been run.
